# Submission For The WebIt hackathon

## Deployment Link:  https://webit-competition.vercel.app/app


Made this flight booking webApp wth my friend @AhmadDecoded. For Backend we used Supabase and for payment we used stripe payment system. There are some Hardcoded flights in the database which you will be able to book.

If you want to work in it then you are free to go, just remember to use "npm install --force" for installing the node_modules
and you have to use "npm i next --force" to install NEXT JS. After that just run "Npm run dev" and you are good to go.
